![Project Cover](/img/cover.jpg "Spectre")
# Spectre
> *Spectre is a lightweight, cross-platform service designed to log and track errors across applications and services. It provides both SOAP and REST APIs, along with a simple JSP-based interface for reviewing logged errors.*

---

## Project Structure

This `README.md` gives an overview of the project structure and instructions on how to build and deploy the application.

## Features

1. **SOAP & REST Web Service**: Exposes a `recordError(String faultCode, String faultMessage, String faultService)` method to record new error.
2. **SOAP & REST Web Service**: Exposes a `getTopErrors(int records)` method to show number of recent errors based on number specified.

## Getting Started

![Project Codes & Tasks](/img/code.jpg "Project Codes and Task")

---

### Prerequisites

>- **Apache TomEE 10**: is the application server used during development, but any Jakarta EE 10-compliant server should work.
>- **Java 23**: Ensure you have Java 23 installed as TomEE 10 targets Jakarta EE 10.
>- **Maven**: The project uses Maven for dependency management with any IDE of choice.

### Dependencies

The required dependencies are defined in `pom.xml`. Below are the key dependencies:

- **Jakarta EE 10 API**: Provides JAX-WS support.
- **JAX-WS**: For SOAP web service implementation.

### Building and Running the Application

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aerosimo/spectre.git
    cd spectre
    ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Deploy the WAR file**:

   After building the project, deploy the generated `WAR` file from the `target/` directory into the `webapps/` folder of your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server.

4. **Start your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server**:

   Start server and access the application:

    - SOAP Service: WSDL at `http://localhost:8081/soap/spectre?wsdl`
    - REST Service: http://localhost:8081/spectre/api/errors
    - Web Interface: `http://localhost:8081/spectre/index.jsp`

## Detailed Explanation of Components

### 1. **SOAP Web Service** (JAX-WS)

The SOAP web service is implemented in `com.aerosimo.ominet.spectre.service.api.SpectreSOAP.java`.

Example recordError SOAP Request:
```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" 
               xmlns:err="https://aerosimo.com/api/ws/spectre">
    <soap:Header/>
    <soap:Body>
        <err:recordError>
            <faultcode>TE10001</faultcode>
            <faultmessage>Random system fault</faultmessage>
            <faultservicename>SoapUI</faultservicename>
        </err:recordError>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```
Example recordError SOAP Response:
```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
    <soap:Body>
        <err:recordErrorResponse xmlns:err="https://aerosimo.com/api/ws/spectre">
            <recordError>ERR|DCWINE62CGH28KQ3DSA0</recordError>
        </err:recordErrorResponse>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```
Example getTopErrors SOAP Request:
```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" 
               xmlns:err="https://aerosimo.com/api/ws/spectre">
    <soap:Header/>
    <soap:Body>
        <err:getTopErrors>
            <records>2</records>
        </err:getTopErrors>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```
Example getTopErrors SOAP Response:
```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
    <soap:Body>
        <err:getTopErrorsResponse xmlns:err="https://aerosimo.com/api/ws/spectre">
            <getTopErrors>
                <errorID>6</errorID>
                <errorRef>ERR|H13B8DNF47G4ZYCBUIWT</errorRef>
                <errorTime>2025-09-18 23:46:04.18626 +1:00</errorTime>
                <errorCode>-1722</errorCode>
                <errorMessage>ORA-01722: invalid number</errorMessage>
                <errorService>auth_pkg (LOG AUDIT): babyboi@omisore.co.uk</errorService>
            </getTopErrors>
            <getTopErrors>
                <errorID>5</errorID>
                <errorRef>ERR|CC4LEQH95INM78P55JR2</errorRef>
                <errorTime>2025-09-18 23:39:35.909077 +1:00</errorTime>
                <errorCode>-1722</errorCode>
                <errorMessage>ORA-01722: invalid number</errorMessage>
                <errorService>auth_pkg (LOG AUDIT): babyboi@omisore.co.uk</errorService>
            </getTopErrors>
        </err:getTopErrorsResponse>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```
### 2. **REST Web Service** (JAX-RS)

The REST web service is implemented in `com.aerosimo.ominet.spectre.service.api.SpectreREST.java`.

Example recordError REST Request:
```json
      {
        "faultCode": "ERR1234",
        "faultMessage": "Null pointer exception in service layer",
        "faultService": "Postman"
      }

```
Example recordError REST Response:
```json
    {
      "errorRef": "ERR|AK0IHE"
    }
```
Example getTopErrors REST Request:
```curl
GET: http://ominet.aerosimo.com:8081/spectre/api/errors?records=2
```
Example getTopErrors REST Response:
```json
[
  {
    "errorID": 9,
    "errorRef": "ERR|AK0IHE",
    "errorTime": "2025-09-20 22:10:34.889266 +1:00",
    "errorCode": "ERR1234",
    "errorMessage": "Null pointer exception in service layer",
    "errorService": "Postman"
  },
  {
    "errorID": 8,
    "errorRef": "ERR|98EK1X",
    "errorTime": "2025-09-20 00:48:21.816125 +1:00",
    "errorCode": "-1722",
    "errorMessage": "ORA-01722: invalid number",
    "errorService": "SoapUI"
  }
]
```
